p10=Rules generated from the tree are shown.\nThis list can be sort by the column name.\nThe list is sort upwards or downwards according to the case.

p09=When releasing the icon on the work area A. is possible to connect the icons \n through a thread B. \n\nWhen  pressing right button on the icon, an emergent menu C appears , \nwhich consists of the following options \:\n\nDelete option, deletes the filter from the work area. \n\nRun option, executes the viewer. \n\nThe view option displays a window to visualize eighter the tree as the generated rules. Its details are explained next.\\\Visualization of the graphic tree\:

p08=This viewer allows a graphic tree generation after a Classification algorithm gets done.\n\nConnection with other drag and drop components is similar \nin every viewer, and it is made as next.
