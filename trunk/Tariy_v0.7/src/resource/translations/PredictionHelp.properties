p02=\u201cPrediction\u201d Icon D appears in the work area. \nUsaje of this component is conditionated to following \nrequirements. \nA training data set must have been loaded A, \n an algorithm for clasification B must be applied to A \nand a testing data set C must had have been loaded to \apply the obtained model after B get done. \n\nInformation coming from A and B feeds\ the icon D. this way, is possible to do prediction on the testing data set C. \n\nGotten data appears in a window \ nas following\:


p01=This viewer lets predict the class value an attribute value belongs to.\n Its fundation is the obtained decision tree \n gotten after an algorithm for clasification been aplayed \nto the data collected from the connection with \n a data base or a text file. \n\n\nConnection with other drag and drop components is made \n with two specific modules which are\: algorithms for classification and connection icons that can be a data base or \ntext files with extension .arf and .csv
