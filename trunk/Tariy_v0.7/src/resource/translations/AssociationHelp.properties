p01=Apriori is an algorithm for association that works\nas follows\:\n\nIn the first sweeping, the algorithm counts how many occurrences an item has \nin the original data set, determinating type 1 frequent item sets. \nThe subsequent steps of the algorithm are two, first, \nfrequent item sets Lk\u22121 found in the first sweeping (k \u2212 1) are \nused to generate candidate item sets Ck. And second, candidate item sets support is counted Ck by means of new sweeping\nto the data base.\nThis process keeps going until frequent item sets are not found anymore.\n\n\nConnection with other drag and drop components, is similar \nin every single algorithm, and it gets done as shown below. 

p08=When acceding to the configuration option, on the work area \nappears a window B, so the user can configure the support \nfor the algorithm. \n\n\nthe execution of all the algorithms for association is similar. \nFor it, we accede to the Run option from the contextual menu.

p07=When executing the algorithm, its icon is changed by an animation, \nas it is in B, which indicates that the process is \nin execution. \n\nthe run time, is proportional to the size of the dat base \nand to the number and type of processes that this algorithm involves. \n 

p06=When releasing the icon in the work area A. is possible to connect the icons \nby means of a thread. \n\nWhen doing click straight on the icon appears an emergent menu, \nwhich consists of the following options \:\n\nthe Delete option, deletes the algorithm icon from the work area. \n\nthe Configure option, adapts the parameters of the algorithm to the necessities \nof the analyst \n\nand the Run option executes the algorithm. \n\n\nthe association algorithms configuration is similar in all of them \nand it gets done as follows\:

p05=FPGrowth is an algorithm for association, uses an innovator and compact \nstructure of data called Frequent Patterns Tree, \nwhich is a structure that stores crucial and quantitative information \nabout the frequent patterns. \n\nWhen building the FP-tree (conditional) and within which \nis carried out recursivamente the mining. \n\nA frequent item set in any transaction always is \nin a path of Frequent Patterns trees. \n\nthe technique used is searching, employee in the Mining \nand it is based in splitting, with the method "divide and conquer". \n\nAll these techniques reduces searching costs . \n\n\nConnection with other drag and drop components, is similar \nin every single algorithm, and it gets done as shown below.  

p04=When acceding to the configuration option, on the work area \nappears a window B, so that the user can configure the support \nfor the algorithm. \n\n\nTo execute the algorithm, we accede to the Run option of the contextual menu.
